# hello-world
This repo is for practicising Github flow.
The objective is to become familiar with how GitHub works.
One day I aspire to be a useful GitHub admin.
I will now archive this repo, as it has served its purpose. 
I then unarchived it, just to practice. 
Next I am going to make this a public repo, again to practice. Then I am going to investigate GitHub Pages, as GitHub seems quite keen to teach me that next.
